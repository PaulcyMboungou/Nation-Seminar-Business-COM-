<p>Business houses across the world are characterized by intense competition in the business world. They are constantly subject to social, political, global, ecological and technological changes that pave way for both opportunities and challenges. As the famous saying goes “Think Globally and Act Locally”, the world economies have transitioned into a global village. This has increased the mobility of cross border business and connectedness. Trade and financial flows integrate the world economy in this globalised era. The presence of foreign market players has increased the need to introspect and focus on business dynamics to analyze the phenomenal changes and to embrace the increasing global opportunities for sustainable development.</p>
