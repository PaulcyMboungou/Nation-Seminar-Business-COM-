        <h2><font color="#0066CC">INSIGHT ON SEMINAR</font></h2>
      </center>
      <p>Business houses across the world are characterized by intense competition in the business world. They are constantly subject to social, political, global, ecological and technological changes that pave way for both opportunities and challenges. As the famous saying goes “Think Globally and Act Locally”, the world economies have transitioned into a global village. This has increased the mobility of cross border business and connectedness. Trade and financial flows integrate the world economy in this globalised era. The presence of foreign market players has increased the need to introspect and focus on business dynamics to analyze the phenomenal changes and to embrace the increasing global opportunities for sustainable development.</p>
      <center><h2><font color="#0066CC">MOTTO OF SEMINAR</font></h2></center>
      <p>The motto behind organizing the National Seminar is to have an academic forum of discussions on the cutting-edge researches on change in business policies or reforms and its impact on sustainable development. It is our strong belief that such a forum will pave way for constructive opinions which can be an innovative tool(s) in stimulating the changing course of business activities.</p>
